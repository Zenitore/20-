So unfortutnately i did not have this created until about 5 min ago and do not have versions for every interation but I can explain most of it

The main file is the "Where to Watch.html" file which consists of the main functinoality of the program. This includes the header, using background, href, and position functions, the body, using href links and images, and the footer using background, href, and positioning

The images and fonts folder contain the images and fonts as expected. this includes the images for the links and background images

Then in the style.css folder it contains all of the css work that I did. this means anything to do with positoining, color, size is done in this file. I used classes for most instances and used many re-occuring ones to acomplish a simpler design.

To run the code simply open the file using google chrome. To inspect the code use visual studio code, or sublime text, or any other text editor, and open the whole project file, then access whatever you find neccessary.
